# Open edX Plugin Examples

[![hack.d Lawrence McDaniel](https://img.shields.io/badge/hack.d-Lawrence%20McDaniel-orange.svg)](https://lawrencemcdaniel.com)

A curated collection of code samples for extending the functionality of an Open edX installation using its built-in plugin architecture.

Technical features that are showcased in this repo include:

* semantic version control
* pre-commit with linting by flake8 and black, both of which are configured to match the opinionated styling that you'll find in Open edX repositories
* pip configuration, requirements, constraints, setup.py, pyproject.toml
* How to bundle multiple plugins in a single pip package
* How to redirect Open edX urls in lms and cms to endpoints created in this plugin
* How to automatically initialize Django model data during app startup
* Adding unit tests to plugin code
* Django app setup
* Open edX Django configuration settings
* Open edX Django urls
* Open edX Django logging
* Open edX Django signals
* Open edX Django RestFramework custom api
* Django models
* Django templating
* Django static assets
* Django Admin
* Django middleware
* Django manage.py custom commands
* Python environment variables
* Waffle flags

## Open edX Plugins in this Repository

### openedx_plugin

Demonstrates how to create an all-in-one Open edX plugin, with a heterogeneous collection of custom feature additions, including:

* A custom third party authentication [Oauth2 client backend](./openedx_plugin/wordpress_oauth2_backend.py).
* Extending [new user registration](./openedx_plugin/student/registration.py) functionality. Demonstrates how to leverage Django Signals to extend basic native Open edX operations.
* Extending the [login functionality](./openedx_plugin/student/session.py)
* Implementing a [rest api](./openedx_plugin/api/README.md) from scratch that is accessible from an LMS url.
* Advanced Internationalization: [customizing static page links](./openedx_plugin/locale/README.md) based on the language locale setting

### openedx_plugin_api

Implements a full-featured [REST API](./openedx_plugin_api/README.md) which is built from snippets of Open edX's built-in rest api libraries. Demonstrates the following:

* Best practices with Django RestFramework for Open edX
* Adding custom URL endpoints to LMS
* Adding Django Admin views
* Creating custom Django models for your plugin
* How to create custom entries in the openedx app log
* How to leverage Django Signals to create customized event-driven features
* How to implement Waffle Switches to control optional features at run-time

### openedx_plugin_cms

Implements a [custom course audit report](openedx_plugin_cms/README.md) in Course Management Studio that depends on a backend Python process to iterate the course content. This process is highly instructive about the Open edX course object hierarchy. This plugin demonstrates the following:

* Adding custom URL endpoints to Course Management Studio
* Adding Django Admin views
* Adding custom manage.py commands to CMS
* Creating custom Django models for your plugin
* How to create custom entries in the openedx app log
* How to leverage Django Signals to create customized event-driven features
* How to implement Waffle Switches to control optional features at run-time
* Advanced usage of Mako templating within an Open edX plugin
* How to programatically iterate and inspect course content
* How to leverage Open edX object caching

### openedx_plugin_mobile_api

Implements a modified version of the Open edX LMS Mobile REST API. This plugin illustrates best practices for modifying edx-platform source code without actually forking this repository. Demonstrates the following:

* How to implement Django middleware to modify the destination of existing LMS url endpoints
* Best practices with Django RestFramework for Open edX

## Getting Started

### Install using Tutor

See [Installing extra xblocks and requirements](https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/configuration.html)

```bash
tutor config save       # to ensure that tutor's root folder system has been created
echo "git+https://github.com/lpm0073/openedx-plugin-example.git" >> "$(tutor config printroot)/env/build/openedx/requirements/private.txt"
cat "$(tutor config printroot)/env/build/openedx/requirements/private.txt"
tutor images build openedx
tutor local quickstart

# you'll also need to run this on your very first install
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. run migrations
tutor local run lms ./manage.py lms makemigrations
tutor local run lms ./manage.py lms migrate
tutor local run cms ./manage.py cms makemigrations
tutor local run cms ./manage.py cms migrate

# 2. add configuration data to custom models
tutor local run lms ./manage.py lms openedx_plugin_init
tutor local run lms ./manage.py lms openedx_plugin_api_init
tutor local run lms ./manage.py lms openedx_plugin_mobile_api_init
tutor local run cms ./manage.py cms openedx_plugin_cms_init
```

### Notes About Django-Waffle

* Each of these four Open edX plugins use [django-waffle](https://waffle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to toggle features on and off. While edx-platform also uses waffle switches, you should note that they separately manage a wrapper project named [edx-toggles](https://github.com/django-waffle/), and therefore the source code in this repo interacts with both of these.

* Waffle switches in each of these four plugins are automatically initialized. You'll therefore find the switches in the LMS Django Admin console (admin/waffle/switch/) of your Open edX installation. Additionally, you'll find the raw MySL database records in the waffle_switch table ![MySQL records](https://github.com/lpm0073/openedx-plugin-example/blob/main/doc/openedx_plugin_waffle_mysql.png?raw=true)

* Look for app startup entries in the LMS app log for diagnostics information about the state of each waffle switch ![app logs](https://github.com/lpm0073/openedx-plugin-example/blob/main/doc/openedx_plugin_waffle_app_log.png?raw=true)

### Local development

* Use the same virtual environment that you use for edx-platform
* Set your Python interpreter to 3.8x
* install black: <https://pypi.org/project/black/>
* install flake8: <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>

```bash
# Run these from within your edx-platform virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

cd /path/to/edx-platform
pip install -r requirements/edx/base.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/coverage.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/development.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/pip-tools.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/testing.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/doc.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/paver.txt

pip install pre-commit black flake8
pre-commit install
```

### Local development good practices

* run `black` on modified code before committing.
* run `flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics`
* run `flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics`
* run `pre-commit run --all-files` before pushing. see: <https://pre-commit.com/>

#### edx-platform dependencies

To avoid freaky version conflicts in prod it's a good idea to install all of the edx-platform requirements to your local dev virtual environment.

* requirements/edx/base.txt
* requirements/edx/develop.txt,
* requirements/edx/testing.txt

At a minimum this will give you the full benefit of your IDE's linter.
